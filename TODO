* be more careful about error-handling and cleaning up after yourself
  when an error occurs
* autotools!
* robust-ify your "test suite"
* make errors return a stack trace instead of a single overwritten message
* code cleanup
* do something about floating-point precision
* implement string operations
* implement if/for/while
* more printing options (e.g., pretty-printing option with multiple lines, indentation, etc.)
