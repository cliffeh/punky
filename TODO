* be more careful about error-handling and cleaning up after yourself
  when an error occurs
* autotools!
* robust-ify your "test suite"
* code cleanup
* do something about floating-point precision
* implement (more) string operations
* better pretty-printing
* allow for multiple -i (in case we want to pre-load a bunch of scripts)
* types to add: file, env
* put "defun" back in as syntactic sugar?
* clean up #includes
* improve logging
