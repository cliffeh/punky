NOTES:

* mathematical operations work in the following way:
  * a math operation with all integer operands will return an integer
  * a math operation with all float operands will return a float
  * a math operation with both integer and float operands will return a float
    * integer operations are used as long as integers are seen in the input;
      as soon as a float is seen, it's all floating-point operations from that
      point regardless of the type of subsequent operands
  * on subtraction: (- a b c d e) is the same as (- a (+ b c d e))
  * on multiplication: (/ a b c d e) is the same as (/ a (* b c d e))
