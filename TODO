* be more careful about error-handling and cleaning up after yourself
  when an error occurs
* autotools!
* robust-ify your "test suite"
* make errors return a stack trace instead of a single overwritten message
* code cleanup
* do something about floating-point precision
* implement string operations
* implement if/for/while
* better pretty-printing
* is there a way i can be more efficient about things such that i don't have to clone so many expr_ts?
* can i do things such that i don't need a bunch of free()s inside eval functions?
* allow for multiple -i (in case we want to pre-load a bunch of scripts)
* be careful about functions that always assume NIL-terminated lists!
* types to add: file, env
